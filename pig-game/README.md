# [Pig Game](https://yanstefanovich.github.io/pig-game/index.html)

## Purpose:
A simple dice rolling game written in JavaScript. This project has been created to help me master JavaScript and practice working with the DOM.

## Game Rules:
Two players take turn rolling the dice. The goal is to be first to reach the agreed upon score. The total score is the summation of the round scores. The round score is determined by the summation of dice numbers rolled that round.

A player may make as many rolls as they wish. However, if they roll two ones in a row they loose their turn and their round score will be zero. If a player rolls two sixes their total score is cleared and they lose their turn.

## Features:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript - Event Handling, DOM Manipulation, App Functions
* Icon Fonts

There is a small problem where the icons are not being loaded with the CDN. Therefore the ionicons package was added to the repo.

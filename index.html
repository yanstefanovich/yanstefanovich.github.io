      <p>Welcome to my placeholder Website. My name is Yan and I am a Web Developer! The majority of my development is done in <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I can build with <strong>HTML</strong> and style with <strong>CSS</strong>. I am well versed in <strong>Git</strong> and I am able use buildtools such as <strong>Gulp</strong> and <strong>Webpack</strong>. At this time, I am exploring/learning <strong>Node.js</strong>. In the near future I wish to finish learning <strong>Angular</strong>. I have not worked with <strong>PHP</strong>, but I am quite familiar with it. Although the only experience I can currently find is as a freelance developer, I am working towards joining a company to learn more about web developing technologies and to progress my career.</p>

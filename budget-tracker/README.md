# [Budget Tracker App](https://yanstefanovich.github.io/budget-tracker/index.html)

## Purpose
This JavaScript application was created to master JavaScript, specifically writing a modular application. This application was designed to work through three data encapsulated modules.

## Features
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript - Event Handling, DOM Manipulation, App Function broken into separate modules
  1. Data Module - Holds data structure, data manipulation methods and stores the data
  2. UI Module - Holds all the DOM elements used by the app and DOM manipulation methods
  3. Control Module - Instantiates the app, handles events, communicates with other modules
* Icon Fonts

## Future To-Do's
* Refactor the data handling code into the backend with Node/Express
* Remake/port the app as an Node/Express app with remote data storing and login
* Deploy the app on Heroku
